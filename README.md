# HideActionBarBorders

![example action bar with borders hidden](./readme/example.png)

A very small and efficient addon to hide the borders of the default action bars in World of Warcraft: Dragonflight.

This will likely interact badly with other action bar addons (including ElvUI) and should only be used with default action bars.

## Getting Square Icons

To get clean, square icons as shown in the screenshot above, download and install [Clean Icons - Mechagnome Edition](https://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info25064-CleanIcons-MechagnomeEdition.html). This is a no-code icon pack that will not impact your game's performance.
